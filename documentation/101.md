# Hackademics

## Getting Started

Straight out of the box, Hackademics provides a simple "plug and play" learning management system for your WordPress site. Below you will find the basic gist of getting everything set up. Remember that Hackademics was built to be easily expandable and configurable; so, if there's a feature you're missing, build it yourself! Refer to the [hooks](hooks.md) documentation for more information on how and where to start.

### Fastest Way To Get Up And Running

The first thing you need is to define the "Class" (over-arching post type for everything). You can have as many classes as you can handle. The slug and other details can be changed by going to *Hackademics->Settings* and looking under the *Class* tab.

The next thing you'll need is a "Lesson". A "Class" really needs at least 1 "Lesson", but can have as many as you like. Again, the slug and other details can be changed by going to *Hackademics->Settings* and lookking under the... *Lesson* tab.

Technically, you could get by with just "Classes" and "Lessons", but we know that sometimes you need more categorization. So, you can also add *Topics* to each *Lesson*; furthermore you can add *Assignments* to every *Lesson*.

Finally, to round off the standard setup, we have "Certificates". These can be awarded upon completion of any Class, Lesson, Topic, Assignment, or any custom Hackademics post type you create.
